# **Monte Carlo Integration**

## **Description**
The Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that predicts possible outcomes of an uncertain event. This is a simple MonteCarlo Integration simulation that numericallly computes a definite integral of the function y=f(x)=3x^4-10x between the values of x =0.0 and x=5.0.

In this simulation a random double value is generated and manipulated into fitting between the ranges of the x values, which in this case is 0.0 and 5.0.

The generated and manipulated value is then used as a parameter for the function f, which is the mathematical function f(x)=3x^4-10x

An estimated integral is found by repeatedly evaluating the function at random values between the given range and calculating the mean value. In this project the value of the function at random points is calculated 99000 times, since the more iterations under the Monte Carlo simulation the higher levels of accuracy.

Then by hardcoding the definite value of the integral, I compared the Monte Carlo Integration result with the actual value of the integral and calculated the error percentage of accuracy.
